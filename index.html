                <p>Hello! I'm Jules, I was born in the Philippines at December 1, 2004. Just like many teenagers, I enjoyed playing games. I specifically enjoy playing the game called <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minecraft">Minecraft</a>. Although Minecraft is a very fun game to build, fight, explore, and lots of stuff to play around with. I was the engineer type of player, I was fascinated by how you can make machines using <a href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Redstone_Dust">redstone dusts</a> as wiring and even mess with the own game by running commands using <a href="https://minecraft.fandom.com/wiki/Command_Block">command blocks</a>. It became my specialty when playing Minecraft, helping my friends make machines to make tasks simpler and efficient.</p>
                <p>After some time, I discovered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_programming">Programming</a> and was happy how it was almost correlated to the things I like doing in Minecraft. I tried watching beginner-friendly programming youtube tutorial videos, made my first "Hello, World" program using Python and immediately fell in love with the Art Of Programming. Months passed by, I discovered <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer_science">Computer Science</a> and went on and researched about it. After reading about it, I learned that it teaches people about algorithms, data structures, and many more all of which are really useful when making complicated programs that does complex tasks. I searched for Computer Science courses online and later learned about <a href="https://online-learning.harvard.edu/course/cs50-introduction-computer-science?delta=0">Harvard's CS50</a> and immediately enrolled, In hopes of extending my knowledge further on technology, and programming.</p>
                <p><span class="badge badge-secondary badge-success">Fun Fact:</span> I found this pretty cool Minecraft bot when I was learning Programming. The name of the bot is <a href="https://2b2t.miraheze.org/wiki/Baritone">Baritone</a>, it supports pathfinding, it builds for you, and many more features yet to come. This is where I started seeing Programming as a complex yet beautiful process, and later lead me to discover Computer Science.</p>
